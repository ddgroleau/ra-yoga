            <p>Hi! I’m Rachel; a Yoga Teacher, mom of Kaia & Randy, and 35 house plants. </p>
            <p>
                I like to say that I’m a movement artist, in the way that people know 
                how to pick up a paint brush and create something so visually enchanting, 
                I was a dancer that felt my deepest expression came from moving my body. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I began practicing yoga asana in my first week of college and knew this was a 
                practice that went deep for me. I knew I needed to deepen my practice and 
                shipped off to Costa Rica for my 200hr YTT 2 months after I graduated. 
                Ever since, I have developed an incredible sense of self, tradition, and an 
                indescribable love of this practice that I am honored to be able to share. 
                The journey into the self is not an easy ride, but it’s one that I am blessed to experience. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I teach a heart-based vinyasa practice. When I lived in in Denver, CO, you 
                could find me at Rooted Heart Yoga & Wellness, and before at Tobyoga in CT. 
                I am constantly guided and learning from my incredible teachers including Jordan 
                Smiley at Courageous Yoga in Denver, Nicki Doane, Jun Lee, Kaya Mindlin, and Sarah 
                Blondin - just to name a few :).
            </p>
            <p>
                As a yoga teacher, I not only believe that movement is medicine, 
                but I believe in noticing what we notice, and feeling it. Yoga is nothing 
                without tradition and breath, which allows us to cultivate a higher sense of self and connection. 
            </p>
            <p>Thank you for being here, from the bottom of my heart. </p>
