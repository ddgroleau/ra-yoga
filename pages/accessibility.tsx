                        At Rachel Aronne Yoga, we strive to ensure 
                        our services are accessible to all people. In order to 
                        achieve this, we have invested important resources 
                        into our site so that it is available to people with disabilities. 
                        We truly believe that website accessibility efforts are vital in 
                        ensuring that all users deserve the right to independence, equality, and ease of use.

                        Using <Link href="https://checker.org">accessibility checker.org&apos;s</Link> audit tool, 
                        https://rachelaronneyoga.com has been scanned for compliance according 
                        to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1). 
                        Since performing the audit, Rachel Aronne Yoga 
                        continues to raise its accessibility standards, with a goal of exceeding those required by the <Link href="https://www.ada.gov/">ADA</Link>.
